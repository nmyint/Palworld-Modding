# AI Repository Workflow

## Purpose

Defines how AI assistants and automated tools should interact with this repository.

## Initial Repository Scan

Always begin with:

1. `README.md`
2. `00_Documentation/RepositoryStructure.txt`
3. `00_Documentation/RepositoryInventory.json`
4. `00_Documentation/AIRepositoryWorkflow.md`
5. Relevant operational documentation in `00_Documentation`
6. `00_Documentation/Scrapbook.md` for historical context

These files define the repository map before deeper inspection.

## File Reading Strategy

Large files must be processed incrementally.

Recommended approach:

1. Inspect file metadata.
2. Identify relevant sections.
3. Read in logical chunks.
4. Reassemble the required context.
5. Modify only the required content.
6. Update the file using the complete validated content.
7. Commit the change with a descriptive message.

### Large File Modification Workflow

When modifying large repository files:

1. Fetch large files in chunks.
2. Reassemble the file contents before editing.
3. Apply the requested change while preserving unrelated content.
4. Validate that no sections were removed accidentally.
5. Update the file.
6. Commit the change.

Do not repeatedly explain tooling limitations when the workflow can proceed. Continue with the established chunked fetch -> edit -> update -> commit process.

Avoid loading:

- large logs
- archives
- generated files
- deployment payloads
- binary content

unless specifically required.

## Priority Order

Preferred reading order:

1. Documentation
2. Configuration
3. PowerShell scripts
4. Tests
5. Project files
6. Generated data

## Repository Boundaries

| Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 00_Documentation | Human and AI knowledge base |
| 01-09 | Data containers and operational areas |
| 10_Scripts | Automation source |
| 11_Utilities | Supporting tools |
| 16_Profiles | Environment configuration |

## Change Discipline

Before modifying files:

- understand existing structure
- inspect related documentation
- preserve existing conventions
- avoid unrelated changes
